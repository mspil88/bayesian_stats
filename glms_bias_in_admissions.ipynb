    "#### On the surface this is a tiny dataset with 12 obs.  These are graduate school applications to 6 different academic departments at UC Berkeley.168 The admit column indicates the number offered admission. The reject column indicates the opposite decision. The applications column is just the sum of admit and reject. Each application has a 0 or 1 outcome for admission, but since these outcomes have been aggregated by department and gender, there are only 12 rows. These 12 rows however represent 4526 applications, the sum of the applications column. So there is a lot of data here—counting the rows in the data table is no longer a sensible way to assess sample size. We could split these data apart into 0/1 Bernoulli trials, like in the original chimpanzees data. Then there would be 4526 rows in the data.\n"

The problem in this case is that males and females do not apply to the same departments, and departments vary in their rates of admission. This makes the answer misleading. You can see the steady decline in admission probability for both males and females from department A to department F. Females in these data tended not to apply to departments like A and B, which had high overall admission rates. Instead they applied in large numbers to departments like F, which admitted less than 10% of applicants. So while it is true overall that females had a lower probability of admission in these data, it is clearly not true within most departments. And note that just inspecting the posterior distribution alone would never have revealed that fact to us. We had to appeal to something outside the fit model. In this case, it was a simple posterior validation check.\n"
